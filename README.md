In this repository i have added all my code that i wrote while learning the Time series forecasting From the famous book Time Series forecasting in Python
 
In these codes i have used the sklearn libraries and its several models such 
1 moving average model
2 Auto regressive model
3 Seasonal model
4 SARIMAX model that is combination of all

I have used multiple datasets the two in this directory are the prices of NIFTY50. I tried a lot predicting the future value but i couldnt find  as the value donot have any correlation and are quite random 
this result is evident from the ACF graph.
